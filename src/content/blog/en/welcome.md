# Welcome to my Blog!

It's finally here – my personal blog is live! After lots of planning and a few late nights of development, I can now share my thoughts, experiences, and tutorials with the world.

## What to expect?

On this blog, I'll be writing about various topics:

- **Tech & Programming**: Tutorials, best practices, and learnings from my projects
- **Personal**: Thoughts on productivity, learning, and the developer life
- **Projects**: Deep dives into my open-source projects and side-projects

## The Tech Stack

This website was built with modern technologies:

```typescript
const techStack = {
  framework: "Next.js 14",
  styling: "Tailwind CSS",
  language: "TypeScript",
  deployment: "Self-hosted with Docker",
};
```

## Stay tuned!

I plan to publish new articles regularly. If you don't want to miss anything, check back often or follow me on social media.

See you soon! 👋
